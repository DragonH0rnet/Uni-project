# Design ideas here

## theme: egg

### name ideas: eggcellent defense? Scrambled Saviour 

tower defense, each round egg hatches new tower
choose egg at start of round
2d top-down

merge towers?

merging gives upgrade points for upgrade tree

enemies: predators
crows, snakes eg

hero tower? unique and upgrades on kill xp instead of merging

bosses with healthbars, abilities maybe freeze nearby towers

free-place towers

trait system, base or upgrade trees give traits to towers. Towers synergise with traits and traits might do more/less damage to enemies

powerful units have aimable power ability

gain xp/currency with score, unlock unique heroes with xp

Clearing stage unlocks new units
